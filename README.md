# Unexpected String Concatenation in JavaScript This example demonstrates a common error in JavaScript stemming from its loose typing system.  When the + operator is used with a mix of numbers and strings, JavaScript will perform string concatenation instead of numerical addition. This can lead to unexpected results, especially when dealing with user input or data from external sources. The solution showcases how to use type checking or the Number() function to ensure that numerical addition is performed as expected. This is a crucial concept for avoiding subtle and hard-to-detect bugs in JavaScript applications.
